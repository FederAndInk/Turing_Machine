(** Given a SINGLE transition -action->, an emulator builds a Turing Machine that simulates the effect of the transition on bands *)
   
type emulator   = State.t * Action.t * State.t -> Turing_Machine.t

(** Translator:
    The encoder converts bands of the original TM, denoted by OTM into bands for the Simulating TM, denoted by STM 
    The decoder converts bands of STM into bands of OTM

    Invariant: decoder(encoder(bands)) =~= bands,  no equality since it can have extra blank cells (B) around
 *)
                
type translator = Band.t list -> Band.t list


(** A simulator is made of 
    - one translator from OTM bands to STM bands : the encoder
    - one reverse translation : the decoder
    - an emulator which builds a STM for each transition of OTM 
 *)
                
type simulator  =
  { name: string ;
    encoder: translator ;
    decoder: translator ;
    emulator: emulator
  }

type simulators = simulator list


(** The structure of the simulator is that of the module Execution in Exection.ml 

    The simulator simulates the execution of the original TM on bands in the following way: 
    - The feasible transition of OTM is selected
    - The emulator builds the STM which simulates the selected transition
    - OBands are translated using the encoder into SBands
    - STM is executed on SBands until completion
    - The modified SBdans are translated back to OBands using the decoder

    The composition of emulators is allowed. For instance, a simulation using [ emulator1 ; emulator2 ] will lead
    
    (q0)-a->(q1) ==emulator1==> TM': (q0) -a_1-> (q') -a_2-> (q1)  which is executed step by step

    then (q0) -a_1-> (q') from TM' ==emulator2==> TM'': (q1) -a_1_1-> (q'') -a_1_2 ->(q')  which is executed
    then (q') -a_2-> (q1) from TM' ==emulator2==> TM'': (q') -a_2_1-> (q'') -a_2_2 ->(q1)  which is executed.
